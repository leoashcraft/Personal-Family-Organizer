<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]][product-screenshot]

There are many great organizers available throughout the interwebs but there's always features that one handles better than the other or something so miniscule that none of them have or are willing to entertain adding (such as timestamps on entries I can use to settle arguments with the wife). While bustling with code for fun and trying to decide on a personal side project to get into, the light went off. This would be the perfect real world project to tackle that I could build off of for years to come and add those little minute features I want -- starting with an audit capabilities.

Here's my main feature goals:

- Lists. Lists. Lists

  - Did I mention lists? I love lists. In fact, I decided it would only be logical to start on lists before any of the other features because 90% of the remaining features would utilize the same components in some way.

- Tasks

  - Closely related to Lists but with organization in mind. Being able to assign tasks to family members could really take the guess work out of who's turn it is to accomplish specific tasks. Maybe a pool of tasks that can be claimed? Incentivized for the kids? 

- Recipes

  - My family has been trying to take a healthier approach and we've discovered it's really difficult to get away from the grimey way of life. We need an organizer of recipes we can quickly refer to. We often find recipes online and modify them in a healthy way but forget to write it down. When we do get them written down, they get stored in emails or Google Drive. It would just be a nice feature to have quick access to.

- Calendars

  - We have great options with Google and integrations with Android and iPhone but it would just be nice to have everything in one place.

- Birthdays!

  - This one isn't as important as Lists or Recipes and will likely be tied into Calendar but my wife has some specific ideas of what she'd like to have, especially when it comes to keeping up with our daughter's friend's birthdays.
 
- Kids Chore Chart

  - Another excellent idea we had is to virtualize our kids chore chart. Again, there's plenty of options out there for similar apps but the main focus here is customization.

Of course, the issue will always remain - what's great for me may not be great for you. Maybe you want to build on my idea of a "yet another family organizer". My main features listed will most definetely expand in the near future as I begin building out. Please, if you have suggestions or want to chip in, fork the repo, create a pull request or open an issue!
